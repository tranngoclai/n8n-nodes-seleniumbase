# n8n-nodes-seleniumbase

This is an n8n community node that allows you to execute Python scraping scripts using the SeleniumBase API.

[SeleniumBase](https://seleniumbase.io/) is a comprehensive Python framework for browser automation and web testing.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Features

- **Execute Python Scripts**: Submit Python code using SeleniumBase for web scraping
- **Async Job Handling**: Automatically polls for job completion
- **Artifact Collection**: Retrieve screenshots, files, and other artifacts generated by your scripts
- **Flexible Operations**: Execute scripts, check status, or retrieve results as separate operations

## Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Execute Script | Submit and execute a Python scraping script |
| Get Job Status | Get the current status of an existing job |
| Get Job Result | Get the full result of a completed job including artifacts and logs |

## Credentials

This node requires connection credentials:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Base URL | The URL of your SeleniumBase API server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) |

## Usage

### Execute Script

1. Add the SeleniumBase node to your workflow
2. Configure the API credentials
3. Enter your Python code in the code editor
4. Enable "Wait for Completion" to get results after the script finishes
5. Execute the workflow

Example Python script:
```python
from seleniumbase import SB

with SB(headless=True) as sb:
    sb.open("https://example.com")
    sb.save_screenshot_to_logs()
    print("Title:", sb.get_page_title())
```

### Output

The node returns:
- `job_id`: Unique identifier for the job
- `status`: Job status (completed/failed)
- `stdout`: Script output
- `stderr`: Script errors
- `artifacts`: List of generated files (screenshots, etc.)
- `error`: Error message if the job failed

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the node
npm run build

# Run in development mode with n8n
npm run dev

# Lint the code
npm run lint
```

## Compatibility

- n8n version: 1.0+
- Node.js version: 18+
